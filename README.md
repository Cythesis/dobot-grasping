### Scenario
The Dobot and conveyor are to be installed as part of an automated pantry. When an operator selects an item, the robot locates it within the pantry, retrieves it and places it on the conveyor belt to be taken out to the user. When the user is done with the item, they can return it to the conveyor. Returning items are identified by the robot and placed back in their previous position.
This scenario will utilise the Dobot and conveyor setup in the Mechatronics Lab. Our group has purchased an Xbox 360 Kinect to act as a visual sensor in the system and will be installed looking down at the setup. Items will be labelled with AR tags to allow for pose estimation by the vision system.
